# TelegramScraper v1.4 ![GitHub repo size](https://img.shields.io/github/repo-size/shakida/TelegramScraper?label=Repo%20Size)
Using this tool you can easily add so many members from any group to your group. Less than 2 minutes. Super easy. Time saver. But this tool is only for educational purpose. You could be banned from Telegram. So be careful. Recommanded to use this tool only on Termux.

## How to Setup API:
- Go to https://my.telegram.org and Login.
- Click on API development tools and fill the required fields.
- Put app name you want & select Other in Platform.
- After clicking Create App, Copy "api_id" & "api_hash" from there. (This will be used in `setup.py`)
